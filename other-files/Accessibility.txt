1. I had to add 'missing form label's to the 'Add a comment' forms, which I was able to do.
The report also wanted me to 
* add more contrast between some of the images and the background
* change the suspicious 'more' link text
* enlarge the timestamp text 

2. I don't think all the accessibility problems are solvable, since users uploading completely white pictures or poor alt text can lead to bad contrast.

3. It is generally pretty usable, though really ugly. 
The different sections are disjoint and in a logical order, and different headings carry semantic meaning.

4. The website is usable if I turn off images for mostly the same reasoning as (3).
